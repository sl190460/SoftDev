                         Facebook Wall Analysis
=============================================================================

Facebook allows users to download all their profile information.
The data comes in an archive containing different files. One of the file 
contains a copy of your wall, with all the entries since the account was 
created.

Now, suppose you want to extract the people that commented the most on the
posts on your wall. For example, given the following
snippet of wall, your command has to print:

 2 John McClane
 1 John Rambo
 1 Chuck Norris

where the first column shows the number of comments, and the second the 
user name.

Submit a text file containing in the first line your command
as you would write it on the shell. Your command will be tested invoking:

> cat wall.html | sh yourfile
